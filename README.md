# SOCIAL NETWORK

### Objectives
Our goal is to create a social network that allows users to create private posts and group posts, follow other users, and see their posts. We will also implement notifications, profile management, groups, private chat, and group chat. We will use Golang for the backend and Angular for the frontend.

### Features
- User registration
- User login
- User profile
- User search
- User follow/unfollow
- User posts
- User notifications
- User groups
- User chat
- User settings
- User logout
- User delete account
- User recover password

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```
2. Go to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd [project-name]
    ```

#### Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2. Run the main script to add dependencies:
    ```bash
    bash main.sh
    ```
3. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    bash run.sh
    ```
4. The server will be running on `http://localhost:${PORT}`.

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Start the frontend server:
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```
   or
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

#### Using the Makefile

You can use the Makefile provided in the project to automate the startup of both backend and frontend servers.

- **Start Backend:**
    ```bash
    make start-backend
    ```

- **Start Frontend:**
    ```bash
    make start-frontend
    ```

- **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    make i-dep
    ```

- **Start Both Servers:**
    ```bash
    make start-all
    ```

The Makefile supports different operating systems (Linux, macOS, and Windows) and automatically detects the OS to run the appropriate commands.
